Dynamic Blog Management System

I have developed a Dynamic Blog Management System using Core PHP following the MVC architecture. The system includes essential features such as:

User Authentication: Secure login and registration and forget password system with password hashing.
Blog Management: Admins can create, update, delete, and view blog posts. Pagination for displaying posts (10 per page).
Comments & Moderation: Users can comment on blog posts, with admin capabilities to approve or delete comments.
Search Functionality: Search for blog posts by title or keywords.
Admin Panel: Manage users, blog content, and comments with secure access.
